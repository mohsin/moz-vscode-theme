# Moz Theme for Visual Studio Code
## Introduction
I'm just experimenting with this custom VS code theme for my own personal use. It's based on my previous theme setting that I used with Sublime Text 3, which was my previous editor. Feel free to use, or contribute if you feel that something looks really messed up and needs to change. Thanks.

## Usage
Just clone this project and press F5 to run it. It would open up an "Extension Development Host" window which updates as you make changes to the cloned folder, simplifying theme development.

## Contributing
Kindly ensure that you include screenshots which highlight the change if you make Pull Requests. I don't really expect any PRs as this is my personal theme so I haven't published this on the VSCode marketplace either.

**Enjoy!**
